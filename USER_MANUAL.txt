CSS 343 Assignment 4 - Store

To build from source:
1) Open the Linux Terminal

2) Change directory to the folder containing your source files

3) Verify that you have three text files in the same directory. These should be named "data4commands.txt", "data4movies.txt", and "data4customers.txt". Verify this with the following commands.
	$ test -e data4commands.txt && echo "File exist" || "File not exist"
	$ test -e data4customers.txt && echo "File exist" || "File not exist"
	$ test -e data4movies.txt && echo "File exist" || "File not exist"
   The console should display "File exist" after each command. If not, load text files of the missing titles into the folder containing the source files.

4) Verify that you have GNU++ installed using the following commands:
	$ whereis gcc
	$ which gcc
	$ gcc --version

5) Type the following command:
	$ g++ bintree.cpp classic.cpp comedy.cpp customer.cpp drama.cpp merchandise.cpp movie.cpp store.cpp transaction.cpp main.cpp -o store.exe
   This will create an executable file named store.exe that you can then run. Continue to step 3 in the next section.

To run from an executable:

1) Open the Linux Terminal.

2) Change the directory to the folder containing the executable file.

3) Change the directory to the executable. if you followed the previous steps, change the directory to store.exe. Otherwise, use the name you gave it.

4) Wait for the program to finish executing.

5) Verify the output to ensure it is as expected

6) Close the Linux Terminal
